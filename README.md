# Introducing software development best practices for the behavioral and social sciences

Research in the behavioral and social sciences (B&SS) is **increasingly relying on complex computational procedures**. Nonetheless, researchers in the B&SS usually have **little formal training** in data management and software development best practices for scientific computing. This situation limits researchers ability to produce data processing pipelines that are **reproducible, reusable, reliable, maintainable, extensible, and shareable** with the wider scientific community. Introducing a **set of simple principles in data management and software development** may significantly help to alleviate this situation and improve the long-term sustainability of research in the social sciences that relies on heavy computation.


In this talk I provide a **few simple principles** that require relatively **low effort** in exchange of **high impact** on improving researchers computational workflows. I also provide a **minimal example** illustrating the application of this simple principles in a data analysis pipeline.

## Getting started

To obtain the files locally:  
```
git clone https://github.com/pabloinsente/sf_for_beh_ss.git
```

To set up your system to run the examples, you need python 3.6.X installed in a Linux/Mac machine. Then install dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
