-> # I'm not a coder, Why should I care? <-


<br>
Research in the behavioral and social sciences is increasingly relying on _complex computational procedures_

<br>
In general, researchers in the behavioral and social sciences have _little formal training_ in software development

<br>
Scientific results heavily depend on the _correctness of computational procedures_

<br>
Incorporating tools and good practices in software development can _increase the pace, quality, and reliability_ of scientific results

***

-> # What is this NOT about <-


<br>
This talk is not about the best way of writing code

<br>
This is not about the best software stack to do projects

<br>
This is not about statistical procedures or machine learning algorithms

<br>
This is not about large scale projects (HPC, HTC, cloud computing, etc)

<br>
Yet, a few tips are offered

***

-> # What this talk is about <-


<br>
Is about practices and tools that can help to accomplish the following goals:

<br>
*_Reproducibility_*: others can reproduce my results given the same data and software environment

<br>
*_Reusability_*: I can reuse part of my code base for other projects

<br>
*_Reliability_*: I can trust my results

<br>
*_Maintainability_*: my code is easy to fix and change

<br>
*_Extensibility_*: I can easily add additional functionality

<br>
*_Shareability_*: I can easily share my code with colleagues and the wider scientific community

***

-> # Keep in mind <-


<br>
I'm not a professional software developer and I don't have a CS degree

<br>
I'm coming from the perspective of a researcher in the social sciences that had to learn complex computational procedures to do research

<br>
This is a _very opinionated talk_, yet informed by literature and expert advice in good practices in software development for scientific computing
